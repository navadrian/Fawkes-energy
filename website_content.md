## Problem Landscape

The battery ecosystem is fragmented and opaque. Different stakeholders operate in silos, leading to massive inefficiencies and risks.

### For EV OEMs
- High warranty and recall costs due to unpredictable battery failures.
- Slow R&D cycles from a lack of real-world performance data.
- Reputational damage from battery-related safety incidents.

### For Fleet Operators
- Unexpected vehicle downtime impacting operations and revenue.
- Suboptimal charging strategies leading to accelerated battery degradation.
- Uncertainty in vehicle residual values due to unknown battery health.

### For Financiers
- Difficulty in accurately assessing the residual value of battery assets.
- High risk exposure in leasing and loan portfolios without SOH data.
- Inability to create innovative financial products like battery-as-a-service.

### For BESS Developers
- Performance degradation faster than projected, affecting project ROI.
- Safety risks associated with thermal runaway events in large-scale systems.
- Inefficient grid augmentation strategies due to poor battery state awareness.

### For Recyclers
- Inaccurate State-of-Health (SOH) data leading to undervalued assets.
- Contamination risks from improperly handled high-voltage batteries.
- Inefficient sorting processes for second-life applications vs. raw material recovery.

### For Charge Point Operators
- Unpredictable charger downtime from hardware faults and software glitches.
- High operational costs from peak demand charges and grid instability.
- Lack of visibility into the health of batteries being charged, leading to inefficient charging cycles.
