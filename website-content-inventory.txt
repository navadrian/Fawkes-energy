SECTION 1: HERO
===============
Headline: "The Universal Operating System for Batteries"
Subheading: "Unlocking safety, performance, and sustainability across the entire battery lifecycle through a unified intelligence layer."

SECTION 2: PROBLEM LANDSCAPE
============================
Main Heading: "The Problem Landscape"
Description: "The battery ecosystem is fragmented and opaque. Different stakeholders operate in silos, leading to massive inefficiencies and risks."

Stakeholder Categories (6 tabs):
1. EV OEMs
2. Fleet Operators
3. Financiers
4. BESS Developers
5. Recyclers
6. Charge Point Operators

STAKEHOLDER PAIN POINTS:

EV OEMs:
- High warranty and recall costs due to unpredictable battery failures
- Slow R&D cycles from a lack of real-world performance data
- Reputational damage from battery-related safety incidents

Fleet Operators:
- Unexpected vehicle downtime impacting operations and revenue
- Suboptimal charging strategies leading to accelerated battery degradation
- Uncertainty in vehicle residual values due to unknown battery health

Financiers:
EV Financing Funnel & Pain Points (4 stages):

Stage 1 - Origination:
- Many buyers lack credit histories
- High upfront EV cost

Stage 2 - Risk Assessment:
- No secondary market
- Outdated ICE-style templates
- Limited performance data on EVs

Stage 3 - Monitoring:
- Reluctance to share IoT data
- Limited technician/service network

Stage 4 - Recovery:
- No traceability of battery health
- No centralized usage/battery database

Overall Impact: These interconnected challenges create significant barriers to efficient EV financing, limiting market growth and increasing costs for all stakeholders in the battery ecosystem.

BESS Developers:
- Performance degradation faster than projected, affecting project ROI
- Safety risks associated with thermal runaway events in large-scale systems
- Inefficient grid augmentation strategies due to poor battery state awareness

Recyclers:
- Inaccurate State-of-Health (SOH) data leading to undervalued assets
- Contamination risks from improperly handled high-voltage batteries
- Inefficient sorting processes for second-life applications vs. raw material recovery

Charge Point Operators:
- Unpredictable charger downtime from hardware faults and software glitches
- High operational costs from peak demand charges and grid instability
- Lack of visibility into the health of batteries being charged, leading to inefficient charging cycles
