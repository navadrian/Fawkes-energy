## Task Details

### Spacing, Typeface & Sizing Consistency Analysis
**Status**: Completed
**Description**: Comprehensive analysis of:
- Spacing consistency (padding, margins, gaps)
- Typeface consistency (font families, sizes, weights)
- Element sizing patterns
- Responsive optimization across breakpoints

**Results**:
- Overall Grade: B+
- Strong foundation with proper typography setup
- Good responsive design with recent mobile optimizations
- Identified inconsistencies in spacing scale, container widths, and hardcoded colors
- 10 prioritized recommendations provided

**Key Findings**:
1. Font setup is excellent (Space Grotesk + Inter)
2. Inconsistent spacing scale (mixing mb-2 through mb-16)
3. 4 different container widths used without clear hierarchy
4. Chart colors use hardcoded HSL instead of CSS variables
5. Button component exists but not used
6. Section titles need responsive scaling
7. Mobile padding could be more responsive

**Recommendations**:
- High Priority: Standardize spacing scale, container widths, make titles responsive, replace hardcoded colors, use Button component
- Medium Priority: Standardize icon sizes, add mobile padding scaling, standardize heading weights
- Low Priority: Add xl breakpoint usage, create reusable card components
