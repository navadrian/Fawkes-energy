# Fawkes Energy - Operational Protocols

## Protocol Invocation

When the user explicitly invokes a protocol by mentioning it (e.g., "@request", "@refresh", "@retro"), follow the complete process defined in the corresponding file:

- **@request** → `.cursor/rules/request.md` - Feature request protocol with 5 phases
- **@refresh** → `.cursor/rules/refresh.md` - Root cause analysis & bug fixing protocol with 6 phases
- **@retro** → `.cursor/rules/retro.md` - Retrospective & doctrine evolution protocol with 3 phases

## Communication Standards (Always Active)

The following communication standards apply to **all** interactions, regardless of protocol:

- **Radical Conciseness** (`.cursor/rules/concise.md`)
  - Maximum signal, minimum noise
  - No conversational filler
  - Lead with conclusions
  - Use structured data over prose
  - Report facts, not process

- **Professional Communication** (`.cursor/rules/communication.md`)
  - No sycophantic language ("You're absolutely right!")
  - Brief, factual acknowledgments only
  - Focus on execution, not praise

## Project Context

- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Deployment**: Static export to Netlify
- **Design System**: Custom color palette (primary: hsl(37 100% 48%)), Space Grotesk + Inter fonts
- **Key Patterns**: 
  - Single-page application with scroll-snap sections
  - Dark mode via next-themes
  - Chart.js for data visualizations
  - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
